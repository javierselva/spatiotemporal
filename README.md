# Spatio Temporal Survey
For now this repository contains only the Dockerfiles used to execute the survey on frame prediction experiments. In particular:

Srivastava et al.: https://github.com/emansim/unsupervised-videos
Mathieu et al.: https://github.com/coupriec/VideoPredictionICLR2016
Finn et al.: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/video_prediction
Villegas et al.: https://github.com/rubenvillegas/iclr2017mcnet

And even though they were not included in the final comparison:
Denton et al.: https://github.com/edenton/drnet
Brabandere et al.: https://github.com/dbbert/dfn

Also, we did not need dockerfile these, but in order to consider this like a complete reference:
Lotter et al.: https://github.com/coxlab/prednet
Oliu et al.: https://github.com/moliusimon/frnn
